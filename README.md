## Fundamentals
- Beware of plagiarism, make sure your code is not accessible to others
    - Run chmod 700 *filename*, when creating new files in public labs
- **CP (Competitive Programming)**
    - An intellectual sport
    - Contestants, known as sport programmers, are challenged to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible 
    - Competing with the world
    - C++ preffered language to get started
    - [ANCC Resources](https://ancc-iitd.github.io/competitive-programming-resources/)
    - Practice makes perfect.
	- Platforms: Codeforces, Codechef, CSES, AtCoder, LeetCode, Hackerrank
    - Compete: ACM-ICPC, Meta Hackercup
    - Really important for placement tests and becoming better at programming in general
- **Software Development**
    - Develop any application that excites you and ship it to the end user.
    - Bring your imagination and creativity in ‚Äúhard‚Äù copy ;) 
    - Learn new skills and build stuff!
    - Necessary for a lot of coding jobs (more important for offcampus) and something that is NOT taught in college
    - CV Point !
    - App Development/Web Development/ML/Game Development/Blockchain Development ...
    - *Web Development*
        - Good skill to begin with in software dev
        - Begin with HTML, CSS, JS and then move onto Fullstack or MERN stack dev
        - A lot of projects/freelance work is actively done
        - Frontend, Backend, UI/UX 
        - [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
        - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
    - *Game Development*
        - Build simple games such as tic-tac-toe or complex ones such as Forza Horizon Series
        - Great option to check out if you have nice creative/art/story-writing skills(not to mention patience ü§ï)
        - Generally no-code

### Operating Systems and Linux
    
- Linux is a family of open source operating systems based on the linux kernel
- Why Linux?
    - It‚Äôs Lightweight compared to windows
    - It‚Äôs Free!!! And open-source, programmers have changed it to make it highly useful for programming and development
    - A Command Line interface along with GUI
    - You will also need Linux for courses,
    - So better get used to a popular Linux distro like Ubuntu.
- VirtualBox: You can use Linux in your windows environment with this.
- It will be useful if you are a beginner to Linux.
- Dual Boot: This means using 2 operating systems on your machine.
- While Dual booting is better than virtual-box, you should always keep a backup of your windows files in case anything bad happens
- You can check this for setup: [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1JVqd8M3Yc)
-  You can check out for tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXyN1aJYefc)
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): If you only want to use linux on CLI but don‚Äôt want to switch from Windows [WSL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvHc8KvoVIA)
- You can also use secure shell (ssh) in your command-prompt to connect to your csc account, which is a linux machine, and use it.

#### Courses
- Extremely important to refer to courses of study and recommended course structure
- Do you core courses on time.
- Look out for prerequisites and overlapping courses
- Build a tentative degree plan
- All courses are not offered in all semesters
- Don‚Äôt fail important courses like which are prerequisite for many courses
- Reach out to your seniors when in doubt

#### Internships
- Spend your first year exploring stuff. (Coursera/YouTube/Udemy)
- Find what you like and get very good at it 
- Build your resume (get overleaf premium using NSUT id).
- Work on projects
- Dedicated sessions closer to intern season in the second and third year

#### Git and GitHub
- Solution to versioning and collaborative development.
- Make a github pro account using NSUT id! 
  
#### StackOverFlow, Google, ChatGPT & Other
- Learn how to get your queries answered from the internet
- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Open Course Wave](https://ocw.mit.edu/)
- [LibreTexts](https://libretexts.org/)
- [Striver](https://takeuforward.org/)
    - Very helpful tool
    - Will help you through all subjects, especially coding 
    - Not just answers, but explanations

#### LinkedIn
- Build your profile
- Network with people
- Learn about opportunities
- Learn professional skills
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

#### Typing
- Extremely useful skill
- [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/), [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) and other similar sites to learn and practice
